# Odin-Tic-Tac-Toe
The Odin Project: Project Odin-Tic-Tac-Toe

## Project Description:
The tic-tac-toe project will allow two players to play against each other as player one and player two.
The players can also enter their names in place of player one and player two.  
Player one will control the X selection unit and player two will control the O selection unit. The player will be an object
declared and initialized by the Players factory function. The Gameboard will be called by an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) or
a module pattern function. This module pattern will have a default win selection for each player to follow in order to win the game. The
player controller and display controller will also be module pattern functions.
